                              of the innermost arrays in case of nested static
                              arrays access.  By default outermost array is
                              used.
  -fchkp-optimize             Allow Pointer Bounds Checker optimizations.  By

                              functions by Pointer Bounds Checker.
  -fchkp-use-static-bounds    Use statically initialized variable for vars
                              bounds instead of generating them each time it is
                              required.
  -fchkp-use-static-const-bounds Use statically initialized variable for
                              constant bounds instead of generating them each
                              time it is required.
